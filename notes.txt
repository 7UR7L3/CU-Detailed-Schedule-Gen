classes.colorado.edu gives us jquery, d3, sam(oauth), and a very friendly api to the database of the courses


saving all to svg https://stackoverflow.com/a/50945965



IDEA: export directly to google calendar or ical

"if you're asian or whatever" switch axis for schedule
be able to select from dropdown or whatever everything that you can select
print schedule
give all course information below schedule

known that this will break with courses with weird start and end date

fix order of divs / fix copy paste; custom copy paste text output

in description fix links of courses to be actually useful

as standalone scheduler not just this stuff

view whole 24 hours or tightfit or pad by a number of minutes

scale to window or default sizing
height and width and font size options. and start and end time / buffer from earliest and latest


have an "add other event" where you pass in a meeting time string and the text you want it to display


# WHY

MyCUInfo homepage doesn't give you professors' names and doesn't align the courses in a human readable way.
MyCUInfo scheduler doesn't give you all information unless you click on the class.
(the old MyCUInfo scheduler (anyone remember that green shit?) gave you almost everything but fucked the time layout (i suppose in favour of compactness but still >.>))
classes.colorado.edu doesn't give you shit unless you hover over and move your eyes and squint.
what the fuck cu.

this bookmarklet gives you the weekly schedule you want.


different colour per class vs custom colour option


gateway into schedule comparer that takes two links and red blue purple overlays them or some shit maybe or interleaved or the google calendar half and half when overlap

put info in border too like start time end time top bottom or time and days at top. maybe
