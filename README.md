CU Detailed Schedule Gen

***repository moved to [https://github.com/7UR7L3/CUSchedule](https://github.com/7UR7L3/CUSchedule)***

this repo is mostly work/scraps for investigating the possibility of making a course schedule which actually presents all the information you could want about the courses you're in. this work amounts to temp3.js being a functional schedule generator which you may run in the dev console of [classes.colorado.edu](https://classes.colorado.edu).

leepfrog technologies (classes.colorado.edu/fose.js) provides an amazing interface for working with schedules.
